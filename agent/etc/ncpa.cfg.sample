# ** Note - The daemon runs as root, but forks a child process when running a plugin
#    that is defined by the user, for security reasons. However, without the main daemon
#    running as root, much of the system information would be missing. This is typical behavior. **

# Extensions for plugins
# ----------------------
# The extension for the plugin denotes how NCPA will try to run the plugin. Use this
# for setting how you want to run the plugin in the command line.
#
# NOTE: Plugins without an extension will be ran in the cmdline as follows:
#       $plugin_name $plugin_args
#
# Defaults:
# .sh = /bin/sh $plugin_name $plugin_args
# .py = python $plugin_name $plugin_args
# .ps1 = powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $plugin_name $plugin_args
# .vbs = cscript $plugin_name $plugin_args //NoLogo
# .bat = cmd /c $plugin_name $plugin_args
#
# Since windows NCPA is 32-bit, if you need to use 64-bit powershell, try the following for
# the powershell plugin definition:
# .ps1 = c:\windows\sysnative\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File $plugin_name $plugin_args
#

# Linux / Mac OS X
.sh = /bin/sh $plugin_name $plugin_args
.py = python $plugin_name $plugin_args

# Windows
.ps1 = powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $plugin_name $plugin_args
