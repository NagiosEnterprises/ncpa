Installing NCPA:
    1. Download MacOS archive (https://www.nagios.org/ncpa/#downloads)
    2. Double click open the disk image file to mount it
    3. Find the installer volume name in the terminal:
         ls /Volumes
         Look for NCPA-<version> (e.g. NCPA-3.0.0)

    4. Run the installer, and follow any user prompts:
         sudo zsh /Volumes/NCPA-<version>/install.sh

Note: if you already have NCPA installed, the installer will upgrade the NCPA software, and retain your configuration.

This is accomplished by stopping then starting the service.
